## Introduction
This repository contains benchmarking tests comparing FireDucks and Pandas for handling large datasets efficiently.

## Setup Instructions
   Run the benchmark script:
   ```sh
   python script.py
   ```

## Benchmarking Details
The script processes [NYC Taxi data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and compares execution times between Pandas and FireDucks.
